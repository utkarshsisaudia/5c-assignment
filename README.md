# Brain MRI Metastasis Segmentation

This project implements **Nested U-Net** and **Attention U-Net** architectures for segmenting metastasis regions in brain MRI images. The objective is to demonstrate proficiency in computer vision techniques and deploy a segmentation model via a web application.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to:
- Implement two deep learning architectures (Nested U-Net and Attention U-Net) to accurately segment metastasis regions from brain MRI scans.
- Develop a web application using **FastAPI** for model inference and **Streamlit** for visualization, allowing users to upload images and view segmentation results.

## Dataset

You will be working with a dataset of brain MRI images and their corresponding metastasis segmentation masks. The dataset has the following structure:
- **Images**: MRI scans of the brain.
- **Masks**: Binary masks indicating the metastasis regions.

The dataset has been split into 80% training and 20% testing sets.
